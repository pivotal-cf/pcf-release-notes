This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and Memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to these stemcells, monitor your PCF VM's current CPU and Memory usage and scale those components, if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, Pivotal recommends scaling that VM.
For more information on monitoring PCF, please see the [Monitoring PCF VMs from Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/monitoring.html) and [Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) topics.

For more information on scaling PCF, see the [Scaling PAS](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-0/opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topic.
Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors. 
Pivotal recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
