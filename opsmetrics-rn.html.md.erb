## Version 1.6.23

### Known issues
For Known Issues, please see the [Ops Metrics Known Issues](opsmetrics-ki.html) documentation.  For Ops Metrics 1.6.X there is one important install ordering dependency before enabling the OpenTSDB firehose nozzle job.

### Major Features
* The addition of CF loggregator data via the firehose is still available, but disabled by default.
  *  This allows the user to install Ops Metrics without Elastic Runtime to monitor Bosh data.
  *  The nozzle should not be enabled until after the user successfully deploys Elastic Runtime (see known issues)
* Ops Metrics still supports the firehose in addition to Bosh and the Collector for data.
* Ops Metrics now asks Elastic Runtime for the port that firehose data comes from.

### Bug Fixes
* Firehose data ingest disabled by default to avoid deadlock condition if Ops Metrics installed before Elastic Runtime.
* Firehose no longer defaults to using 4443 to read data, and instead asks Elastic Runtime for the port the firehose comes from.

### Notes
* Upgrading from Ops Metrics 1.4.X to 1.6.X will leave the firehose nozzle job disabled (since it did not exist previously).
* Upgrading from Ops Metrics 1.5.X to 1.6.X will enable the firehose nozzle by default (since it was enabled before upgrading).
  * If you are upgrading to resolve an installation error with 1.5.X, immediately disable the firehose job before deploying, and enable once you have deployed Elastic Runtime.
* Stemcell for 1.6.23 is 3263.8
