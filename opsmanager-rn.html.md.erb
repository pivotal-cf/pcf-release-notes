## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>

Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='om-api-rotate-credhub-certs'></a> Ops Manager API Rotates CredHub Certificates and Certificate Authorities

When you rotate certificate authorities and leaf certificates using the `certificate_authorities/active/regenerate` Ops Manager API endpoint, the API includes certificate authorities and leaf certificates stored in CredHub.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager does not rotate the CredHub certificates for MySQL for Pivotal Platform and Pivotal CloudCache services.</p>

For more information about rotating certificates using the Ops Manager API, see [Rotating Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html). For more information about the `certificate_authorities/active/regenerate` endpoint, see [Rotate Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-9/opsman-api/#create-root-certificate-authorities) in the Ops Manager API documentation.

### <a id='authentication-update'></a> Ability to View and Update Ops Manager Internal Authentication Settings

In Ops Manager v2.9, operators can view and update Ops Manager internal authentication configuration by using the Ops Manager `/api/v0/settings/authentication` API endpoint or by accessing the **Settings** pane of the Ops Manager UI.

For more information about accessing the **Settings** page, see [Using the Ops Manager Interface](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/2-9/pcf-interface.html#settings).

### <a id='advanced-mode-banner'></a> Advanced Mode UI Banner

Ops Manager displays a banner in the UI when you are in Advanced Mode. This helps you understand when you are in Advanced Mode. It also helps ensure that you remember to exit Advanced Mode when you complete the required work. 

For more information about how to enable Advanced Mode in Ops Manager, see [How to Enable Advanced Mode in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base. 

### <a id='advanced-mode-fields'></a> Additional Unlocked Settings in Advanced Mode

In Ops Manager v2.9, the following **Director Config** fields can be unlocked in Advanced Mode after you apply changes:

* **Blobstore Location**
* For AWS S3:
    * **S3 Endpoint**
    * **S3 Bucket Name**
    * **V2 Signature in S3** 
    * **V4 Signature in S3**
    * **Region in V4**
* For GCS:
    * **Bucket Name in GCS**
    * **Storage Class in GCS**
    * **Service Account Key in GCS**
* For Luna HSM:
    * **Partition Serial Number**

You can also modify these properties by using the `api/v0/staged/director/properties` Ops Manager API endpoint.

To unlock these fields or properties, you must use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode.

For more information about fields that can be unlocked in Advanced Mode, see the [Unlockable Fields](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/customizing/lock-on-deploy.html#unlock) section in _Ops Manager Fields That Lock On Deploy_.

### <a id='domain-style'></a> Support for Virtual-Hosted-Style URLs for AWS S3 Blobstores

Ops Manager supports virtual-hosted-style, or domain-style, URLs for AWS S3-compatible blobstores. This allows you to use virtual-hosted-style URLs for S3-compatible blobstores before AWS deprecates path-style URLs for S3 buckets in October 2020. 

Ops Manager continues support for path-style URLs for S3-compatible blobstores until they are deprecated by AWS. 

For more information about the deprecation process for path-style S3 bucket URLs, see [Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan – The Rest of the Story](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/) in the AWS News Blog.

To use a virtual-hosted-style URL for an AWS S3-compatible blobstore:

1. Go to the Ops Manager **Director Config** pane.

1. In the **S3 blobstore** section, for the **S3 URLs Style** dropdown, select domain-style URL. 

For more information about the difference between path-style and virtual-hosted-style URLs, see [Virtual Hosting of Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation. 

### <a id='open-api-spec-docs'></a> Ops Manager API Documentation Uses the Open API Specification

In v2.9, Ops Manager API documentation adopts the Open API Specification (OAS). In addition to general format improvements, this update provides operators with a machine-parsable version of the Ops Manager API docs.

For more information about OAS, see [The OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
