### <a id='java-app-sidecars'></a> Java Apps Support Sidecars (Beta)

Pushing apps with sidecars is a beta feature that released with PAS v2.6.0.

### <a id='mtls-routing-api'></a> Enhanced Security for Routing API with mTLS

Traffic between the Routing API and other routing components is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption. This provides additional security for communication between routing components in PAS.


### <a id='syslog-agent'></a> Syslog Agents Enabled by Default

Syslog Agents are enabled by default, and the option to disable Syslog Agents is removed. Syslog Agents run on host VMs and component VMs, increase the number of syslog drain service bindings supported by the Loggregator system, and reduce the workload for Loggregator VMs.


### <a id='ldap-nfs'></a> nfsbroker Back End is in CredHub

The nfsbroker back end is migrated to CredHub. This allows you to specify LDAP credentials when you create an NFS Volume Service instance.

You can do the following in Apps Manager to manage app re-deployments and revisions:

- View revisions for an app.

- View the deployment status of an app revision.
- View the environment variables associated with an app revision.


### <a id='apps-manager-redesign'></a> Apps Manager UI Redesign

The Apps Manager UI is redesigned with improved navigation and an updated look and feel. The improved navigation appears in a panel on the left side of the screen, which allows you to more quickly access settings and resources for the orgs, spaces, apps, and services in your environment.

### <a id='rdp-removed-bosh-ssh'></a> RDP Support is Removed in Favor of BOSH SSH

<p class="note warning"><b>Warning:</b> This feature is a breaking change. See <a href="./breaking-changes.html#rdp">RDP is Not Supported</a> in <i>PCF v2.7 Breaking Changes</i>.</p>
