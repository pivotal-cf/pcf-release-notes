## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The procedure for upgrading to Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.1 is documented in the [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud
Foundry](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic.

When upgrading to v2.1, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* To successfully upgrade to PAS v2.1, you must first upgrade to a version of Elastic Runtime v1.12.

* Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.1. Pivotal is
  working with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the
  latest versions of PCF.<br/><br/> For information about which partner service
  releases are currently compatible with PCF v2.1, review the appropriate
  partners services release documentation at
  [https://docs.pivotal.io](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner
  organization that produces the tile.

## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in PAS v2.1

### <a id='route-consistency'> Improved Resiliency and Consistency for Application Routes

Gorouter now uses TLS to verify app identity by default.
This improves resiliency and consistency for app routes.
For more information about how Gorouter uses app instance validation to keep its routing table current,
see [Routing to App Instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/concepts/http-routing.html#apps).

You can change this setting by disabling the **Router uses TLS to verify application identity** checkbox in the **Networking** pane of the PAS tile.
Disabling it sets Gorouter to send traffic unencrypted and rely on pruning to maintain its routing table.

### <a id='keepalive-connections'> Gorouter Keepalive Connections to Backends Enabled by Default

In PAS v2.1, the **Router Max Idle Keepalive Connections** field in the ** Networking** pane of the PAS tile has been replaced by the **Enable Keepalive Connections for Router** checkbox.
The checkbox is enabled by default, and the maximum number of idle keepalive connections maintained by Gorouter to all backends is set to 49,000. This improves routing performance.

### <a id='healthchecks'> Improved System Performance for App Health Checks

This release changes how PAS runs app health checks to improve
system performance in resource-constrained environments, such as on-premise
installations of PAS. This change does not impact the developer workflow for
[configuring app health checks](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).

Previously, health checks during app startup increased system load because they
ran as a Garden process every two seconds. In addition, apps that started successfully
could fail if slow system performance caused the app health check to
time out. In some severe cases, such app failures caused additional resource
consumption and a chain-reaction of app failures.

PAS v2.1 resolves these issues through a new implementation that does not
invoke a new process on every health check. The health check now runs
as a long-lived process in the app container. Developers may see these
processes if they access an app container using the `cf ssh` command and list the
processes.

### <a id='saml-uaa'> Custom SAML Entity ID for Tiles

To enable tiles to set a custom SAML entity ID, independent of whether PAS itself uses an external SAML identity provider,
the **Entity ID Override** field in the **Authentication and Enterprise SSO** pane of the PAS tile has been moved to the **UAA** pane and renamed to **SAML Entity ID Override**.

### <a id='multi-user-error'></a> cf CLI Errors on Multi-Origin User Ambiguity

If multiple CF user accounts from different origins share a username, the commands that manage Space and Org user roles return an error instead of operating on the first account returned. See [Identical Usernames in Multiple Origins](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/2-1/cf-cli/getting-started.html#multi-origin) for details.
